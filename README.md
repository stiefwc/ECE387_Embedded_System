README

For the ECE387 final project, I created a home-made camera dolly. This report will be documenting the build process of a home-made camera dolly and provide information on how you can apply this work to your own instance. This version of the camera dolly features an Arduino, two twelve-volt DC motors for the drive train, and a stepper motor for the panoramic camera control.
