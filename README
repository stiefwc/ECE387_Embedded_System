For my final project for ECE387 I will be creating a robotic car, which will be powered by 2 DC Motors as well as a driver board such as the L298N. The robotic car will be controlled by a joystick, and powered by some sort of battery pack.

If the robotic car idea is taken, I will make an electronic panorama head for photography and videography. The panoramic camera attachment will be rotated with a stepper motor, and it will have various setting which can be adjusted through the use of a few buttons. The options for the camera attachment can be displayed on an LCD screen.
